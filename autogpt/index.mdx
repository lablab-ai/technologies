# Auto-GPT
Auto-GPT is an experimental application that demonstrates the power of the GPT-4 language model in an autonomous setting. It combines the capabilities of GPT-4 with additional data sources and technologies. As one of the first examples of GPT-4 running fully autonomously, Auto-GPT pushes the boundaries of what is possible with AI.
