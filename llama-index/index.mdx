### LlamaIndex - Use cases
Use cases for LlamaIndex

* [Queries over your Data](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use_cases/queries.html) 
LlamaIndex gives you the ability to query your data for any downstream LLM use case.
  * [Semantic Search](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/vector_stores/SimpleIndexDemo.html) LlamaIndex provides an in-memory vector store for semantic search applications.
  * [Summarization](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use_cases/queries.html#summarization) ListIndex in LlamaIndex is best suitable for summarization usecase which goes through all the data.
  * [Queries over Structured Data] (https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/tutorials/sql_guide.html) LlamaIndex provides an interface to query over structured data.
  * [Synthesis over Heterogeneous Data] (https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to/index/composability.html) LlamaIndex helps in synthesizing across heterogeneous data sources by composing a graph over your existing data.
  * [Routing over Heterogeneous Data] (https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/query_engine/RouterQueryEngine.html) LlamaIndex supports routing over heterogeneous data sources - for instance, if you want to “route” a query to an underlying Document or a sub-index.
  * [Multi-Document Queries] (https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use_cases/queries.html#multi-document-queries)  LlamaIndex supports generating a “query plan” containing sub-queries against sub-documents before synthesizing the final answer.
  * [Multi-Step Queries] (https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/query_transformations/SimpleIndexDemo-multistep.html) LlamaIndex can help to break a complex query into initial subquestions, and sequentially generate subquestions based on returned answers until the final answer is returned.
  * [Temporal Queries] (https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to/query_engine/advanced/second_stage.html) LlamaIndex supports quries that require understanding of time. 
* [Agents](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use_cases/agents.html) Documentation for building Agents with LlamaIndex.
* [Integrations into LLM Applications](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use_cases/apps.html#) Documentation for building Chatbots and Full-Stack Web Application with LlamaIndex.
