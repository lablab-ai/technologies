# BabyAGI
BabyAGI is a Python project that demonstrates an AI-powered task management system that uses OpenAI and Pinecone APIs to create, prioritize, and execute tasks. The system creates tasks based on the result of previous tasks and a predefined objective, and uses the LLMs capabilities to create new tasks based on the objective. It runs in an infinite loop that pulls tasks from a task list, sends them to the execution agent, enriches the results using Pinecone, and creates new tasks based on the objective and the result of the previous task.
