#  LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI)

LLaMA is a state-of-the-art foundational large language model designed to help researchers advance their work in the subfield of AI. It is available in multiple sizes (7B, 13B, 33B, and 65B parameters) and aims to democratize  access to large language models by requiring less computing power and resources for training and deployment. LLaMA is developed by the FAIR team of Meta AI and has been trained on a large set of unlabeled data, making it ideal for fine-tuning for a variety of tasks.
