# Alpaca

Stanford Alpaca is an open-source project that demonstrates the capabilities of an instruction-following LLaMA model. Developed by a team of researchers at Stanford University, Alpaca is designed to understand and execute tasks based on user instructions. The project provides a dataset, data generation process, and fine-tuning code for reproducibility.
