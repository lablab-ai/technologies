# Generative Agents
Generative Agents are computer programs designed to replicate human actions and responses within interactive software. To create believable individual and group behavior, they utilize memory, reflection, and planning in combination. These agents have the ability to recall past experiences, make inferences about themselves and others, and devise strategies based on their surroundings. They have a wide range of applications, including creating immersive environments, rehearsing interpersonal communication, and prototyping. In a simulated world resembling The Sims, automated agents can interact, build relationships, and collaborate on group tasks while users watch and intervene as necessary.
