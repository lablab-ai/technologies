# CAMEL
CAMEL stands for Communicative Agents for "Mind" Exploration of Large Scale Language Model Society. The purpose of this framework is to enhance the collaboration among AI chat agents to achieve tasks with minimal human involvement. The project aims to come up with effective ways of understanding the thinking patterns of these agents and finding solutions to the challenges they encounter while working together in a scalable manner. CAMEL provides a role-playing approach and inception prompting to guide chat agents in completing tasks that align with human intentions. Research into communicative agents can greatly benefit from this approach as it enables us to thoroughly examine and assess agent behavior and abilities. By addressing cooperation challenges, CAMEL can enhance the performance of conversational AI systems.
